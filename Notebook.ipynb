    "# Reproduction of \"Refusal in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a quick reproduction of the paper [Refusal in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717) by Andy Arditi, Oscar Obeso, Aaquib Syed, Daniel Paleka, Nina Panickssery, Wes Gurnee, and Neel Nanda.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook and the paper is to make language models safer, where safety means tuning language models to *refuse* to give responses that may be used to cause harm. The paper and this notebook demonstrate that refusal in language models is very brittle: with 50 lines of code and a trivial 200 item dataset, we will hack Llama 3 to often stop refusing and instead give harmful responses. So, we show that a lot more work is needed to make these safer models truly safe.\n",
